Description: The goal of 'clarite' is to guide a dataset from the raw data stage to EWAS analysis and 
	     subsequent visualization of results. The package is designed to lead a user through the 
	     stages of data cleaning: from generating descriptive statistics, to making QC decisions 
	     informed by the descriptive statistics, to running analyses on the filtered dataset and 
	     visualizing the results.
